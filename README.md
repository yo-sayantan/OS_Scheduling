# OS_Scheduling
This scheduler project enables the user to enter the process details that occur inside the CPU (Process Scheduling) and I/O. This program shows the output as which processes enter first and how it executes (parallelly) and for what time, CPU &amp; I/O status, etc. The user can also switch between different types of scheduler algorithms to get better results.
