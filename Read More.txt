The code is written for UBUNTU GCC.
The link.sh file can only be executed in Ubuntu GCC.
The whole folder should be placed in a directory accessible via Terminal.
Then execute the link.sh file.
All the other codes wiull be executed automatically.
We can switch between one scheduler to another scheduker algo seamlessly just by choosing the options.

Thank you.
